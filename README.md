# Data Structures and Algorithms Solutions

This project contains solutions to various data structures and algorithms problems from the [Take U Forward](https://takeuforward.org/) website.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide clear and efficient solutions to a wide range of data structures and algorithms problems. Each solution is implemented in a clean and understandable manner, with comments and explanations where necessary.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

## Data Structures

This section covers various data structures and their implementations:

- Arrays : Fixed-size data structures that store elements of the same type.
- Linked Lists: Dynamic data structures where each element points to the next.
- Stacks: LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structures.
- Queues: FIFO (First In, First Out) data structures.
- Trees: Hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes.
- Graphs: Collections of nodes connected by edges.

## Algorithms

This section covers various algorithms and their implementations:

- Sorting Algorithms: Techniques to arrange elements in a particular order (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
- Searching Algorithms: Techniques to find elements within data structures (e.g., Binary Search).
- Dynamic Programming: Optimization technique to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems.
- Greedy Algorithms: Techniques that make locally optimal choices at each step.
- Graph Algorithms: Techniques to traverse and analyze graphs (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm, Depth-First Search).
